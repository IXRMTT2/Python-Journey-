My journey of learning python

Did some udemy courses + sololearn and freecodecamp projects to help me better understand python, you can see my learning journey.

If you want to see my other python projects go for it, it's in my repos, these are just some basic ones I had but didnt have a title to put it under to make it look visually pleasing.
